Dataset Descriptions
--------------------
We will use part of MNIST image dataset for this assignment. All the data are in 'data' folder namely 'train.txt' and 'test.txt'. Here are the details of the dataset information:
		             samples   image size   labels 
Training Dataset      1561      16*16      1 or 5
Testing Dataset       424       16*16      1 or 5

We already extracted two features as your input.
feature1: symmetry
feature2: average intensity
Here are the details of the feature information:
		             samples   feature numbers   labels 
Training Dataset     1561           2           1 or 5
Testing Dataset       424           2           1 or 5


Assignment Descriptions
-----------------------
There are total three Python files including 'main.py', 'solution.py' and 'helper.py'. In this assignment, you only need to add your solution in 'solution.py' file following the given instruction. However, you might need to read all the files to fully understand the requirement. 

The 'helper.py' includes all the helper functions for the assignments, like load data, extract features, etc. The 'main.py' is used to test your solution. 

Notes: Do not change anything in 'main.py' and 'helper,py' files. Only try to add your code to 'solution.py' file and keep function names and parameters unchanged.  


Submitting requirements
-----------------------
Please submit a write-up to briefly report your results and the ‘solution.py’ file to the BeachBoard.
